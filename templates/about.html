      I am <strong class="text-primary">Muhammad Saqlain Amin</strong>, an
      <span class="text-primary">AI Developer</span> and dedicated problem
      solver driven by passion, purpose and pure persistence.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not just write code. I craft intelligent systems that solve real
      problems. From Python to Django, machine learning to APIs, I love
      transforming complex logic into smooth and impactful user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether its building full-stack applications or fine-tuning ML models, I
      thrive on challenges that push boundaries and sharpen my skills.
      Debugging? I see it as a brain workout.
    </p>

    <p>
      My mindset is simple:
      <span class="text-primary"
        >Never stop learning. Never stop building.</span
      >
      I am obsessed with growth and every failure fuels my future.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe in community, collaboration and sharing knowledge. Because tech
      is not just about lines of code, it is about changing lives.
